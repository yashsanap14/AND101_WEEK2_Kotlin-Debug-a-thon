# AND101 Project 2 - Kotlin Debug-a-thon

Submitted by: **Yash Kishor Sanap**

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

## Summary

**Kotlin Debug-a-thon Widgets** is an Android app that was riddled with some pretty nasty Kotlin bugs. With those gone, it's a collection of widgets for a variety of purposes, including a "Hello World" display, a number summation tool, a current day viewer, a random color generator, a list printer, a favorite number saver, and a source for daily inspiration with random quotes!

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: **[🐛➡️💡]**

## Notes

During this project, I significantly improved my Kotlin debugging skills. Tracing errors like `ActivityNotFoundException` and `Unresolved reference` taught me the importance of meticulously checking the `AndroidManifest.xml`, ensuring correct resource ID naming in XML and Kotlin, and understanding the Android build process. Implementing the "Inspirational Quote" widget was a good exercise in handling string arrays and basic UI updates. The Logcat became an invaluable tool for pinpointing runtime issues.
